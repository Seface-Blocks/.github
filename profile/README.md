## About us
Seface Studios aims to create experiences focused on electronic games, bringing learning and fun to those who consume our products.

Always willing to create unique and quality experiences and products, with our own projects or services provided to third parties.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/15kgsym.png" width="16" height="16" /> As a Brazilian team, we have an internal incentive for Brazilians who want to learn how to develop content for games like Minecraft or Fortnite. We know how difficult the game and development market is in our country, so we are here to help with whatever is necessary.

## Archived Projects

We have a philosophy that old non-commercial projects that have been archived or will not be updated should be shared with everyone! Therefore, [click here](https://github.com/Seface-Studios/.github/blob/main/ARCHIVED_PROJECTS.md) to see the list of archived projects that can already be used freely.
